# What is this codebase?
This is the Sauce Labs Sample Application which is designed to be used from desktop web browsers

# Setup
There are 2 ways to use this project. 

- use a setup where you already have a Development/Test environment set up which has all dependencies installed, like Chrome, Java and all prerequisites for ReactJS, see [Already Set Up](./README.md#already-set-up)
- use Vagrant which gives you all the tools and dependencies out of the box, see [Vagrant](./README.md#vagrant).

## Already set up

In order to set up and use this project and start contributing follow this step by step guide:

1. You’ll need [Node.js](http://nodejs.org) installed (at least v10.x.x or higher). If you don't have Node installed, we recommend installing [NVM](https://github.com/creationix/nvm) to assist managing multiple active Node.js versions.
1. Fork the project. 
1. Clone the project somewhere on your computer
    
        git clone git@github.com:<your-username>/sample-app-web.git

1. Install all dependencies

        npm install

1. Build the application with

        npm run start
    
    This will build the application, start Chrome and load the website on [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/)
 
1. Click around - this is the app!



### Test

To run the application test suite (which uses Webdriver.io, Selenium, and Chrome) make sure the application is running on [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/), see above steps 

1. `npm test`

This will run the application test suite - screenshots generated by the tests will be placed in _[project-root]_`/screenshots/**/*.png`, and the output can be found [here](./README.md#test-output).


## Vagrant
To set up the development environment for this sample app:

1. Install [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/)
2. Install [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/)
3. Run the `setup-env.sh` script in the root of the repository
4. There is no step 4, you're done!

### Direct development environment setup

You can also choose to build the application directly on your host computer rather than via Vagrant/Virtualbox, however this is discouraged due to interdependency issues which frequently crop up when running multiple NPM projects in the same development environment. The usage of Vagrant/Virtualbox is intended to prevent this issue by giving this application a pristine build environment with only its dependencies present, however the usage of Vagrant/Virtualbox is not a strict requirement for building this application.

To set up the development environment directly on your host computer:

1. Install [NodeJS 10 LTS](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
2. Update NPM to the latest version: `sudo npm i npm@latest -g`
3. Install the application dependencies - in the root of the repository: `npm install`
4. Install [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/) for running the end-to-end tests
5. Install [OpenJDK 8](https://adoptopenjdk.net/) for running the end-to-end tests

### Setup issues

If you encounter any issues with this build process, e.g.:

```
$ npm run build
> sample-app-web@1.0.0 build /Users/unlucky-user/sample-app-web
> webpack --mode production

sh: webpack: command not found
npm ERR! file sh
npm ERR! code ELIFECYCLE
npm ERR! errno ENOENT
npm ERR! syscall spawn
npm ERR! sample-app-web@1.0.0 build: `webpack --mode production`
npm ERR! spawn ENOENT
npm ERR! 
npm ERR! Failed at the sample-app-web@1.0.0 build script.
npm ERR! This is probably not a problem with npm. There is likely additional logging output above.

npm ERR! A complete log of this run can be found in:
npm ERR!     /Users/unlucky-user/.npm/_logs/2019-06-19T02_09_09_082Z-debug.log
$
```

You have probably hit a dependency conflict issue. To resolve this, do the following in the root of the repository:

1. `npm cache clean --force`
2. `rm -rf node_modules`
3. `npm install`
4. `npm run build`

### Build

To build the application:

1. `vagrant ssh` inside the project folder
2. On the VM: `cd /usr/local/saucelabs/sample-app-web`
3. On the VM: `npm run build`
4. Again, no step 4. The build is complete!

#### Run

To run the built application (which is a static website):

1. Open _[project-root]_`/dist/index.html` in a web browser
2. Click around - this is the app!


#### Test

To run the application test suite (which uses Webdriver.io, Selenium, and Chrome):

1. `vagrant ssh` inside the project folder
2. On the VM: `cd /usr/local/saucelabs/sample-app-web`
3. On the VM: `npm test.vagrant`

This will run the application test suite - screenshots generated by the tests will be placed in _[project-root]_`/screenshots/**/*.png`, and the output can be found [here](./README.md#test-output).
